We forget to treat our bodies well. We are dissatisfied with how we look. We resort to drastic diets, exercise regimes, in a bid to reap the benefits of the next ""quick fix"".Made Real calls a stop to this negativity -- We advocate instead a wholesome lifestyle that goes beyond the extremities of the modern day diet.

Nutrition affects us in unexpected ways -- Repeated intake of sugary foods could make us feel sluggish, for instance. We feel rejuvenated after a workout session, causing us to feel pumped, energetic, and motivated. At the same time, health is intertwined with how confident we feel about our bodies, and determines how far we're able to utilize our bodies to actualize our dreams.Made Real promotes open discourse to eliminate the taboo of discussing body-image issues, which are more pertinent than ever in today's media-obsessed world. We hope that individuals with a negative sense of self can recover a spirit of positivity through good nutrition, an active lifestyle, and an optimistic outlook. We are deeply in touch with the relationship between wellness and confidence, and hope to bring this to our community.INDEPENDENCE: We stand for the makers, the ones who put in time, energy, and thought to shape your foods. They know what has gone into the food, and are unashamed to tell you what exactly went in -- Because there are no nasties!
