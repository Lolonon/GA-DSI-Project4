**about aspire**

today in southeast asia, 50% of small & medium businesses (smes) don't have access to credit because banks do not make enough profit on small size loans. over here at aspire, we aim to fill that massive gap by providing loans to smes in the region while also assessing the credit risks of borrowers via our proprietary risk modelling engine, which helps us to disburse loans within 24 hours to applicants. we strongly believe in the future of automation & machine learning and we seek to harness its' potential to help us evaluate the risk of borrowers to its highest degree of accuracy.

founded in january 2018, we have since raised over us$9 million during our seeding round in early 2018, which includes investors such as y-combinator (a us-based seed accelerator that has invested in startups such as dropbox, airbnb and reddit) and insignia ventures.
