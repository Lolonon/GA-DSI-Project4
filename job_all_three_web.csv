We have flexible hours, but it’s definitely not a 9-5 job. Building something great is never easy, so only those with grit and determination will survive. You've got to be willing to do whatever it takes.It's a young team here. Young, hungry and maybe foolish. That’s what makes us so dangerous. We do have a team of amazing investors and advisors backing and supporting us though - they fuel our growth not just with cash but also guidance and mentorship. These are people you will get to learn directly from too.PURPOSE - Why We DoEvery company has its own mission. But without a great team, its mission can only remain a dream. Not reality.By helping companies to build successful teams, we are creating a ripple effect of positive impact on the world by helping companies to realize their missions.Every young person has an ambition.

Not reality.By helping young talent to discover opportunities they love and to develop the right skills they need, we are helping millions to realize their potential.VISION - Where We're HeadingWe are the #1 recruitment platform in Asia for companies to build successful teams with young talent.Asia has one of the fastest and largest youth workforce on the world. Yet, there is no great recruitment and career platform that is built for employers of this demographic and to this group of young talent.The traditional recruitment and headhunting industry is also poised to be disrupted by the marketplace economy.It is an eventuality that there will be a dominant recruitment and career discovery platform for the millenials in Asia.One that shakes up the traditional recruitment industry at the same time.Why not us?MISSION - What We DoWe help companies build successful teams by:Placing suitable candidates to openings via our algorithm and platformBuilding their brand awareness to engage and outreach to young talentCULTURE CODE - #BRIBCOCulture matters.

'multimodal deep learning:\xa0towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources\n currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. in each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. a multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance.\n \n unsupervised deep learning:\xa0towards 10x fewer labeled samples\n labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible.\xa0 the aim is to achieve the same performance with 10x fewer labeled training samples.\xa0 this is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts of unlabeled unstructured data.', 'deep learning on embedded devices:\xa0towards 100x smaller models\n current deep learning models have 10s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware.\xa0 the aim is to achieve models that are 100x smaller, with little loss in performance. this capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models.', 'online deep learning:\xa0towards near real time (nrt) model updates\n state-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive gpu infrastructure. a
